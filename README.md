# Spring Boot Learning Repository

This repository serves as a structured learning journal where I implement various concepts of Spring Boot. My goal is to strengthen my expertise in Java Development and become job-ready for a Java Software Engineer role.

## 🧠 Overview

The project demonstrates various Spring Boot modules and concepts, including:

* **bootapibook**: Demonstrates building RESTful APIs.
* **springbootjpa**: Showcases integration with JPA for database operations.
* **springbootweb**: Illustrates web application development using Spring Boot.

Each module serves as an educational example to understand the trade-offs between simplicity, resource utilization, and concurrency in server design.
